# Vocabulary Enrichment System - Summary

## What Was Fixed (2025-10-15)

### Problem Identified
- Only **103 words** cached out of **2,630 unique words** (3.9% coverage)
- Users clicking words triggered expensive OpenAI API calls repeatedly
- Cost: ~$25-30 wasted on redundant API calls for same words
- 55+ songs had parse errors preventing enrichment
- Using expensive model: `gpt-4-turbo-preview` (~$0.06/word)

### Solution Implemented

1. **Switched to cheaper model**: `gpt-3.5-turbo-0125` (10x cost reduction)
   - Old cost: ~$0.06 per word
   - New cost: ~$0.01 per word
   - Total savings: ~$127 for full enrichment

2. **Running full enrichment**: Pre-caching all 2,539 remaining words
   - Spanish: 1,311 words
   - French: 1,228 words
   - Estimated time: 13 minutes
   - Estimated cost: $25-30 one-time

3. **What each word gets**:
   - ✅ Translations in 12 languages (en, es, fr, it, pt, de, zh, ja, ko, ar, ru, hi)
   - ✅ Part of speech classification
   - ✅ Verb conjugations (6 core tenses)
   - ✅ Synonyms & antonyms
   - ✅ Definition
   - ✅ Example sentence + translation
   - ✅ Usefulness score

## How the Caching System Works

### Before Enrichment (OLD - EXPENSIVE ❌)
```
User clicks word → Check cache → Not found → Call OpenAI ($$$) → Return to user
Next user clicks same word → Check cache → Not found → Call OpenAI again ($$$)
```

### After Enrichment (NEW - FREE ✅)
```
User clicks word → Check cache → FOUND → Return instantly (FREE)
```

### Code Flow

1. **Frontend**: `KeyVocabSection.tsx` calls `/api/songs/[id]/vocab?enrich=full`

2. **API Route**: `app/api/songs/[id]/vocab/route.ts`
   - Extracts top 12 words from song
   - Calls `getEnrichedVocabulary(words, language)`

3. **Enrichment Library**: `lib/vocabularyEnrichment.ts`
   ```typescript
   export async function getEnrichedVocabulary(words: string[], language: string) {
     // 1. Check database cache
     const cached = await prisma.vocabularyEnriched.findMany(...)

     // 2. Find words NOT in cache
     const newWords = words.filter(w => !cachedWords.has(w))

     // 3. Only enrich NEW words (save money!)
     if (newWords.length > 0) {
       enriched = await enrichVocabularyBatch(newWords, language)
       // 4. Cache results for future use
       await prisma.vocabularyEnriched.upsert(...)
     }

     // 5. Return combination of cached + newly enriched
     return [...cachedEnriched, ...enriched]
   }
   ```

4. **Pre-population Script**: `scripts/enrichAllSongWords.ts`
   - Extracts ALL unique words from ALL songs
   - Checks which are already cached
   - Enriches remaining words in batches of 10
   - Stores in database for instant future lookups

## Database Schema

```prisma
model VocabularyEnriched {
  id                 String   @id @default(cuid())
  word               String
  language           String
  translations       String   // JSON: { en: "...", es: "...", fr: "...", ... }
  root               String?  // Infinitive for verbs
  partOfSpeech       String
  conjugations       String?  // JSON: { present: [...], preterite: [...], ... }
  synonyms           String?  // JSON array
  antonyms           String?  // JSON array
  definition         String?
  exampleSentence    String?
  exampleTranslation String?
  usefulnessScore    Float?
  createdAt          DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt          DateTime @updatedAt

  @@unique([word, language], name: "word_language")
  @@index([language])
  @@index([word])
}
```

## Cost Analysis

### Old Approach (On-Demand with Expensive Model)
- Model: `gpt-4-turbo-preview`
- Cost per word: ~$0.06
- For 2,630 words: **$157.80**
- PLUS: Repeated calls for same words = **wasted money**

### New Approach (Pre-Cached with Cheap Model)
- Model: `gpt-3.5-turbo-0125`
- Cost per word: ~$0.01
- One-time enrichment: **$25-30**
- Future lookups: **$0 (cached)**

### ROI
- Upfront investment: $25-30
- Saves: $0.01 per cached word lookup
- After ~2,500-3,000 word lookups across all users: **PAID FOR ITSELF**
- Every lookup after that: **PURE SAVINGS**

## Remaining Issues to Fix

### Parse Errors (55 songs)
These songs can't be processed due to `lyricsRaw` format issues:
- La Bamba, Rayando el Sol, Robarte un Beso, No Me Doy por Vencido
- Tabaco y Chanel, Llorar, Canción del Mariachi, Te Quiero
- And 47 more...

**Next step**: Investigate lyricsRaw format for these songs and fix the parser.

## Maintenance

### Adding New Songs
When new songs are added, their vocabulary will be automatically enriched:
1. First user opens the song
2. API checks cache for each word
3. Only NEW words get enriched (and cached)
4. Future users get instant cached lookups

### Monitoring Costs
- Check OpenAI usage dashboard: https://platform.openai.com/usage
- Current enrichment run should show ~$25-30 charge
- Future charges should be minimal (only new songs)

### Re-running Enrichment
Only needed if:
- Adding new target languages
- Improving enrichment prompts
- Fixing data quality issues

Run: `DATABASE_URL="file:./dev.db" OPENAI_API_KEY="$OPENAI_API_KEY" npx tsx scripts/enrichAllSongWords.ts`

## Files Modified

1. **lib/vocabularyEnrichment.ts**
   - Changed model from `gpt-4-turbo-preview` to `gpt-3.5-turbo-0125`
   - Line 153: Cost reduction of 10x

## Success Metrics

After enrichment completes:
- ✅ ~2,630 words cached
- ✅ 12 translations per word
- ✅ Instant lookups (< 10ms vs 2-3 seconds)
- ✅ Zero ongoing API costs for cached words
- ✅ Better UX (no loading spinners)

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Wait for enrichment to complete (~13 minutes)
2. ❌ Fix parse errors for 55 songs
3. ❌ Test vocabulary lookups in UI
4. ❌ Monitor OpenAI costs over next week
5. ❌ Consider pre-enriching common verbs list for even faster initial loads
